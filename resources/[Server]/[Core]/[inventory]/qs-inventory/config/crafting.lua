    Configuring the Crafting System

    The qs-inventory's crafting system is entirely independent, meaning it operates without 
    needing additional DLC. This crafting system is designed to be intuitive and adaptable 
    to your server needs, allowing you to create complex recipes and control crafting outcomes 
    with ease.

    Noteworthy features:
    - Customizable success rates per item (1-100%), which sets the probability of successful crafting.
    - Reputation-based access to crafting recipes (specific to QBCore) that allows items to unlock 
      based on a player's reputation points.

    Read through each section to understand the structure of the system, and check examples below 
    for reference on crafting items.

    **Important:** If you use the Reputation system, be sure to configure the 'rep' fields and thresholds 
    based on your server’s design.

Config.Crafting = true -- Toggle the crafting system on or off

--[[
    Reputation System (Exclusive to QBCore Framework)
    
    The reputation system restricts certain crafting items until a player reaches a required level.
    This can be configured per item in the crafting recipes. For example, a higher-level item 
    may require a specific amount of reputation points to unlock.

    Built-in Reputation Types for QBCore:
    - 'craftingrep' and 'attachmentcraftingrep'

    Set thresholds to only show items that match or exceed a player’s reputation level.
]]

Config.CraftingReputation = false -- Enable to activate reputation gating for crafting items (QBCore only)
Config.ThresholdItems = false      -- Items only visible if rep >= threshold; QBCore-only feature

--[[
    Crafting Recipes Configuration

    Below is an example of how to define crafting items. Each entry contains:
    - Item name and amount crafted
    - Resource costs required for crafting
    - Slot position, item type, and crafting time
    - Reputation requirements and chance of successful crafting
    
    Customize each field to suit your server, and remember to set 'chance' carefully.
    Higher chance values reduce the likelihood of item breakage.
