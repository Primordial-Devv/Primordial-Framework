    Framework Detection and Configuration Guide for qs-inventory

    This inventory system automatically detects whether you are using `qb-core`, `es_extended`, or `qbx_core`
    as your main framework, assigning it to `Config.Framework` accordingly. However, if you have renamed
    any of these resources, or use a modified framework setup, you may need to update this configuration manually.

    To set up manually:
        1. Remove the automatic detection code by clearing `Config.Framework`'s value.
        2. Replace it with the name of your custom framework setup.
        3. Update any relevant framework-specific functions within the script's client and server files.

    Warning:
    ‚ö†Ô∏è The automatic framework detection is set for standard setups. Avoid modifying this section
    unless you have a deep understanding of the framework structure, as incorrect modifications
    could disrupt functionality.

    Remember, for the inventory system to work seamlessly, make sure `qb-core`, `es_extended`,
    or `qbx_core` (or their equivalent files) are running at startup.

    Backward Compatibility Mode for qs-inventory Migration

    The `Config.FetchOldInventory` setting is designed for users migrating data from an older version of qs-inventory to the current system.

    - **Purpose:** When set to `true`, this option initiates a one-time data migration process, transferring all relevant inventory data from the old qs-inventory to the updated version.
    - **Completion Alert:** Once the migration is successfully finished, a message saying `Backward compatibility has been completed` will display in your console.
    - **IMPORTANT:** After the migration is complete, immediately switch `Config.FetchOldInventory` back to `false`. Keeping it enabled after migration can result in potential errors, as the script is not intended to run with backward compatibility enabled long-term.
    - **Usage Warning:** Do not use or modify other settings in the script while `Config.FetchOldInventory` is active, as this is a one-time migration setting designed solely for data transfer.

    Ensure to read the documentation for any additional guidance on migration steps.

Config.FetchOldInventory = false -- Set to `true` only once to start the migration process, then return to `false` immediately after.

    General Configuration Guide for the Inventory System

    This section outlines various customization options available within the qs-inventory system. Each setting allows
    for detailed customization, from item targeting methods to inventory slot configurations and item interaction options.
    To adjust the settings for your server, carefully review each parameter below. Note that certain adjustments (e.g.,
    slot limits or item weight capacities) may require special attention to avoid issues with existing inventories.
